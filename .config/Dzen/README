Please edit everything to your liking. Only takes like 3 hours. Kidding.
Everything is noted so it should be fine and easy to use. But if anything Let me know.

 - I'm using a Conky-Cli version and a DZEN with XFT support from AUR

 - I find it best to put the startup on your .Xinitrc

 - (Openbox Users)
   Add this to your Application section on your rc.xml
   It allows the dzen to dock and changes it to a bottom layer. 
   (Dzen2 likes to stay on top by default)

 <application class="dzen" name="dzen2">
   <layer>below</layer>
 </application>
