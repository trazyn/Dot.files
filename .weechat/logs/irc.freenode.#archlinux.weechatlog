2012-07-25 16:23:46	supasnashbuhl	okay, my udev rule now looks like this: DEVPATH=="/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:11.0/ata3/host2/*", ENV{UDISKS_SYSTEM_INTERNAL}="0", ENV{ID_DRIVE_DETACHABLE}="1", ENV{UDISKS_AUTOMOUNT_HINT="always" and it doesn't work. I still have to have root acces to mount it.. Is there something wrong with it. Maybe the quotes?
2012-07-25 16:24:07	starlays	oskude: remved the 20-virtualbox.conf, and putted the default config in the file 10-evdev.conf, the same config that you have, rebooted, now, for the moment it is working well
2012-07-25 16:24:24	oskude	yay

2012-07-25 16:24:39	supasnashbuhl	the bracket..
2012-07-25 16:24:44	Earnestly	Is it utterly impossible to have multiworded aliases? Or whitespace basically.

2012-07-25 16:26:13	supasnashbuhl	damn, this would be so sweet
2012-07-25 16:26:24	grawity	Earnestly: What do you need multiworded aliases for?

2012-07-25 16:27:32	Earnestly	grawity: msys, so I can still use "pacman -Syu" :P, I can simply make a function
2012-07-25 16:27:49	supasnashbuhl	i'll post this on bbs.. maybe someone there knows a solution. :/
2012-07-25 16:27:51	grawity	dspider: won't work unless you also escape it when running the actual command

2012-07-25 16:28:53	Earnestly	Yup, just a thought. So I can still type pacman on msys
2012-07-25 16:29:04	grawity	Also. Why does `pkill dbus` return "no criteria specified"? WHAT IS THIS CONSPIRACY
2012-07-25 16:29:14	grawity	Earnestly: hmm, I heard pacapt does something similar?
2012-07-25 16:29:19	Earnestly	That being said, I should really make pacman aliases. Shrug, typing it out isn't time consuming
2012-07-25 16:29:44	grawity	I dunno, I type `pacman -Syu` often enough that it's already easier than an alias
2012-07-25 16:29:57	Earnestly	Exactly
2012-07-25 16:30:10	w0ng	Is it possible to universally remap Shift+Insert to Super_L+p for pasting primary buffer?
2012-07-25 16:30:42	grawity	no
2012-07-25 16:30:53	grawity	It is possible to universally remap Shift+Insert to Super_L+p
2012-07-25 16:31:10	grawity	but Shift+Insert doesn't always paste primary buffer, and there's not much you can do to fix that

2012-07-25 16:33:00	Earnestly	It doesn't?

2012-07-25 16:33:50	grawity	Firefox from CLIPBOARD
2012-07-25 16:34:04	Earnestly	Really? I use shiftins on both Linux and Windows firefox (although in Window's case, yeah, ctrl-v)
2012-07-25 16:34:20	Earnestly	Could it be pentadactyl?

2012-07-25 16:34:39	grawity	much more consistently than in X
2012-07-25 16:34:41	Earnestly	I know
2012-07-25 16:35:05	w0ng	i shift+ins in firefox for me too, well except some apps (e.g. wordpress) where it seems only pasting from clipboard works
2012-07-25 16:35:10	Earnestly	Ah, well I've yet to come across something that ignores shift insert fortunately.
2012-07-25 16:35:20	grawity	$ gsel <<< "Primary"; gclip <<< "Clipboard"
2012-07-25 16:35:29	grawity	Firefox pastes "Clipboard" on Shift+Ins
2012-07-25 16:35:46	Earnestly	That said, in Firefox, shift+insert to another X program sometimes cuts off the beginning of the text by a few letters mysterously
2012-07-25 16:35:47	w0ng	i use pentadactyl and that pastes primary

2012-07-25 16:38:39	Earnestly	Well, you can get aur packages with .sig files, but you'll need to manually trust their keys

2012-07-25 16:39:33	a0x	which is what I'm tired of having to do
2012-07-25 16:39:50	grawity	Earnestly: a .sig can only be made when you actually have a package, and since you build the package yourself, it's signed with your key
2012-07-25 16:39:54	w0ng	so how would i go about remapping shift+ins? looking at a few mans, xmodmap seems to remap single keys, xbindkeys seems to map key combos to commands

2012-07-25 18:12:22	Fififox	hi! I've been struggling with network proplems since yesterday and I must admit I don't really know what I'm doing. I've got a modem/router (192.168.1.254) and two Arch boxes connected. Sadly, the modem's connection doesn't work since yesterday but I can connect to internet though my phone (/dev/usb0 on box 192.168.1.5). How can I share that connection with with the other computer on the LAN (192.168.1.2)
2012-07-25 18:12:24	Fififox	? I tried IP forwardin, IPIP tunnelling, iptables stuff and all the guides you could imagine and yet it doesn't work (either host unreachable or timeouts). Help? :)

2012-07-25 19:51:17	MrElendig	urxvt doesn't have a zillion deps
2012-07-25 19:51:21	keenerd	Nah, VTEs work out of the box and don't drag in deps other than GTK.
2012-07-25 19:51:28	Earnestly	But once you've configured it to your liking, you're set and will probably never need to touch it again.
2012-07-25 19:51:40	guardian	keenerd: that's again something that just doesn't fit my personality I guess :D I can spend hours deciding which of the dozen of apps doing the same thing. I hate it even more when the apps are all in v 0.0.x and maybe the author got a girlfriend in the meantime ;)
2012-07-25 19:51:42	Earnestly	There's also gtk3-light in the aur
2012-07-25 19:51:55	Earnestly	Which is much, much lighter on deps compared with gtk3
